### ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT CONVERSION WEBHOOKS:**

Since conversion webhooks are bound to a CRD definition, installing more than 1
helm release has to be done with caution to avoid conflicts.

Users can use `ko-crds.enabled` to install and manage operator's CRDs.
`global.webhooks.conversion.enabled` can be set to `true` to enable the conversion webhook.
Any subsequent helm release after the first one that enables these options,
must not set either of these to `true` to prevent ownership conflicts.

Moreover, `env.enable_conversion_webhook` must be set to `false` in all
releases except the first one that enables it, otherwise operator deployments may fail.
The operator deployment that has been installed as first, will handle the conversions.

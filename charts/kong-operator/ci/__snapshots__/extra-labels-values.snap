          AIGateway is a network Gateway enabling access and management for AI &
          Machine Learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM).

          The underlying technology for the AIGateway is the Kong Gateway configured
          with a variety of plugins which provide the the AI featureset.

          This is a list of the plugins, which are available in Kong Gateway v3.6.x+:

            - ai-proxy (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-proxy)
            - ai-request-transformer (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-request-transformer)
            - ai-response-transformers (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-response-transformer)
            - ai-prompt-template (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-template)
            - ai-prompt-guard-plugin (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-guard)
            - ai-prompt-decorator-plugin (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-decorator)

          So effectively the AIGateway resource provides a bespoke Gateway resource
          (which it owns and manages) with the gateway, consumers and plugin
          configurations automated and configurable via Kubernetes APIs.

          The current iteration only supports the proxy itself, but the API is being
          built with room for future growth in several dimensions. For instance:

            - Supporting auxiliary functions (e.g. decorator, guard, templater, token-rate-limit)
            - Supporting request/response transformers
            - Supporting more than just LLMs (e.g. CCNs, GANs, e.t.c.)
            - Supporting more hosting options for LLMs (e.g. self hosted)
            - Supporting more AI cloud providers
            - Supporting more AI cloud provider features

          The validation rules throughout are set up to ensure at least one
          cloud-provider-based LLM is specified, but in the future when we have more
          model types and more hosting options for those types so we may want to look
          into using CEL validation to ensure that at least one model configuration is
          provided. We may also want to use CEL to validate things like identifier
          unique-ness, e.t.c.

                  CloudProviderCredentials is a reference to an object (e.g. a Kubernetes
                  Secret) which contains the credentials needed to access the APIs of
                  cloud providers.

                  This is the global configuration that will be used by DEFAULT for all
                  model configurations. A secret configured this way MAY include any number
                  of key-value pairs equal to the number of providers you have, but used
                  this way the keys MUST be named according to their providers (e.g.
                  "openai", "azure", "cohere", e.t.c.). For example:

                    apiVersion: v1
                    kind: Secret
                    metadata:

                      azure: *****************
                      cohere: *****************

                  See AICloudProviderName for a list of known and valid cloud providers.

                  Note that the keys are NOT case-sensitive (e.g. "OpenAI", "openai", and
                  "openAI" are all valid and considered the same keys) but if there are
                  duplicates endpoints failures conditions will be emitted and endpoints
                  will not be configured until the duplicates are resolved.

                  This is currently considered required, but in future iterations will be
                  optional as we do things like enable configuring credentials at the model
                  level.

                                Temperature controls the randomness of predictions by scaling the logits
                                before applying softmax. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.0 to 0.7) makes
                                the model more confident in its predictions, leading to more repetitive
                                and deterministic outputs. A higher temperature (e.g., 0.8 to 1.0)
                                increases randomness, generating more diverse and creative outputs. At
                                very high temperatures, the outputs may become nonsensical or highly

                                TopK sampling is a technique where the model's prediction is limited to
                                the K most likely next tokens at each step of the generation process.
                                The probability distribution is truncated to these top K tokens, and the
                                next token is randomly sampled from this subset. This method helps in
                                reducing the chance of selecting highly improbable tokens, making the
                                text more coherent. A smaller K leads to more predictable text, while a
                                larger K allows for more diversity but with an increased risk of
                                incoherence.

                                TopP (also known as nucleus sampling) is an alternative to top K
                                sampling. Instead of selecting the top K tokens, top P sampling chooses
                                from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the
                                threshold P. This method dynamically adjusts the number of tokens
                                considered at each step, depending on their probability distribution. It
                                helps in maintaining diversity while also avoiding very unlikely tokens.
                                A higher P value increases diversity but can lead to less coherence,
                                whereas a lower P value makes the model's outputs more focused and
                                coherent.

                                        preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                        container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                        PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                        container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                        period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                        or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                    RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                    This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                    For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                    the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                    Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                    this init container will be continually restarted on
                                    exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                    containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                    will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                    is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                    container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                    for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                    container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                    init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                    completed.

                                An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
                                user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                                scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                                removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                                Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                                To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
                                Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                                    Variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. If a variable

                                    to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e. "$$(VAR_NAME)" will
                                    produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)". Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless

                                        PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                        API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                        preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                        container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                        PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                        container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                        period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                        or until the termination grace period is reached.

                              Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                              init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                              to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                              unique among all containers.
                              Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                              The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                              by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                              that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                              in a similar fashion.
                              Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                        PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                        period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                        or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                    the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                    Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                    this init container will be continually restarted on
                                    exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                    containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                    will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                    is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                    container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                    for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                    container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                    init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                    completed.

                                        Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate gracefully upon probe failure.
                                        The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                        a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                                        Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                                        If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this

                                  seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                  It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                  Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                  "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                  This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                  "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                  This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                  It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                  Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                  whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                  CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                  "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                  If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                  If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                  and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                  This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                  All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                    to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                                    for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.

                                    MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                    When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                    between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                    The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                    or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                    In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                    | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                    |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                    - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                    scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                    violate MaxSkew(1).
                                    - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                    When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                    to topologies that satisfy it.
                                    It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                    MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                    When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                    Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                    And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                    this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                    As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                    scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                    If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                    Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                    When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                    | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                    |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                    The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                    In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                    because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                    it will violate MaxSkew.

                                    ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                    The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                    and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                    Use this if:
                                    a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                    b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                       tracking are needed,
                                    c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                    d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                       a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                       information on the connection between this volume type
                                       and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                    Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                    APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                    of an individual pod.

                                    Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                    be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                    more information.

                                    A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                    persistent volumes at the same time.
                                  properties:
                                    volumeClaimTemplate:
                                      description: |-
                                        Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                        The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                        owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                        pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                        `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                        entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                        is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                        An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                        will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                        volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                        meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                        owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                        this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                        manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                                provisioner.
                                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                  specified.
                                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                  in any namespaces.
                                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                        Similarly, the volume partition for /dev/sda is "0" (or you can leave the property empty).

                                    image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                    The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                    - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                    - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                    - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                    The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                    A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                    The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                    The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                    The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                    Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                    The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                        IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                        Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                        The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                    RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                    This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                    For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                    the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                    Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                    this init container will be continually restarted on
                                    exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                    containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                    will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                    is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                    container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                    for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                    container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                    init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                    completed.

                                          recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                          field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                          supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                          an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                          If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to

                                          If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
                                user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                                scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                                removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                                Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                                To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
                                Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                                        preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                        container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                        PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                        container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                        period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                        or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                        The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                        a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.

                                        If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this

                                    support namespace targeting then the result of setting this field is undefined.

                                          If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                          If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                              ImagePullSecrets is an optional list of references to secrets in the same namespace to use for pulling any of the images used by this PodSpec.
                              If specified, these secrets will be passed to individual puller implementations for them to use.

                              Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                              init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                              to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                              unique among all containers.
                              Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                              The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                              by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                              that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                              in a similar fashion.
                              Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                        container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                        PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the

                                        period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                        or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                    RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                    This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                    For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                    the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                    Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                    this init container will be continually restarted on
                                    exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                    containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                    will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                    is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                    container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                    for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                    container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                    init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                    completed.

                                          If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                          If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                  seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                  It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                  Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                  "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                  This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                  "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                  This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                  It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                  Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                  whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                  CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                  "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                  If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                  If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                  and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                  This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                  All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                    scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                    violate MaxSkew(1).

                                    MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                    When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                    Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                    And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                    this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                    As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                    scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                    If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                    Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                    When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                    labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                    | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                    |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                    The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                    In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                    because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                    it will violate MaxSkew.

                                    We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                    - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.

                                      but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                      skew.
                                    A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                                    "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                    For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                    | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                    If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                    to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                    MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler

                                ephemeral:
                                  description: |-
                                    ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                    The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                    and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                    Use this if:
                                    a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                    b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                       tracking are needed,
                                    c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                    d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                       a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                       information on the connection between this volume type
                                       and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                    Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                    APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                    of an individual pod.

                                    Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                    be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                    more information.

                                    A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                    persistent volumes at the same time.
                                  properties:
                                    volumeClaimTemplate:

                                        Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                        The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                        owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                        pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                        `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                        entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                        is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                        An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                        will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                        volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                        meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                        owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                        this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                        manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non

                                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                                provisioner.
                                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                  specified.
                                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                  in any namespaces.
                                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                    image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                    The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                    - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                    - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                    - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                    The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                    A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                    The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                    The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                    The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                    Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                    The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                        Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                        IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                        Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                              ExternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
                              receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,
                              ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                              the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                              of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                              the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                              be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                              routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                              features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                              within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                              when picking a node.

                              Type determines how the Service is exposed.
                              Defaults to `LoadBalancer`.

                              `ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints.

                              `NodePort` exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort).
                              To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address,
                              the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.

                              `LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.

                              UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy pods
                              should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods,
                              as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".

                              Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow.
                              If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used,
                              which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.

                              IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                              but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not
                              disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy).
                              Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                              AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                              but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless
                              of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running
                              pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy.
                              Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                              Additional policies may be added in the future.
                              Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods
                              if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.

                              This field is beta-level. The eviction API uses this field when
                              the feature gate PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy is enabled (enabled by default).

                                              "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".

                                              exists or not.

                                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                        completed.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                    An EphemeralContainer is a temporary container that you may add to an existing Pod for
                                    user-initiated activities such as debugging. Ephemeral containers have no resource or
                                    scheduling guarantees, and they will not be restarted when they exit or when a Pod is
                                    removed or restarted. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the
                                    Pod to exceed its resource allocation.

                                    To add an ephemeral container, use the ephemeralcontainers subresource of an existing
                                    Pod. Ephemeral containers may not be removed or restarted.

                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                  Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                  init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                  to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                  unique among all containers.
                                  Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                  The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                  by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                  that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                  in a similar fashion.
                                  Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                        completed.

                                              RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                              recursively.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                              recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                              recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                              field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is

                                              an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                              If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                              None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                              If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                        MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                        spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                                        to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                                        for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                        MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                        Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                                        be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                        This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                                        MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                        to topologies that satisfy it.
                                        It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                                        TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key

                                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                        e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                        Use this if:
                                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                           tracking are needed,
                                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                           information on the connection between this volume type
                                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                        of an individual pod.

                                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                        more information.

                                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                    dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                    volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                    core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                                    the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                                    provisioner.
                                                    This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                    compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                    value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                    When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                      specified.
                                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                      in any namespaces.
                                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                        completed.

                                            API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                  Init containers are executed in order prior to containers being started. If any
                                  init container fails, the pod is considered to have failed and is handled according
                                  to its restartPolicy. The name for an init container or normal container must be
                                  unique among all containers.
                                  Init containers may not have Lifecycle actions, Readiness probes, Liveness probes, or Startup probes.
                                  The resourceRequirements of an init container are taken into account during scheduling
                                  by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                  that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                  in a similar fashion.
                                  Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.

                                            PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an

                                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                        completed.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                              recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                              recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                              field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                              supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                              an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                              If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                              None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                              If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                        Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                                        be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                        This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                                        MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                        to topologies that satisfy it.

                                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                                        TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key

                                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.

                                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod

                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same

                                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                        Use this if:
                                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                           tracking are needed,
                                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                           information on the connection between this volume type
                                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                        of an individual pod.

                                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                        more information.

                                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                    dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                    volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                                    core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                                    When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                                    This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                    if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards

                                                    both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same

                                                    When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                    dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                      specified.
                                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                      in any namespaces.
                                                    (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                    (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                            fsType is the filesystem type of the volume that you want to mount.
                                            Tip: Ensure that the filesystem type is supported by the host operating system.
                                            Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                                  ExternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
                                  receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,
                                  ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                                  the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                                  of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                                  traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                                  the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                                  be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                                  routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                                  features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                                  within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                  a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                                  when picking a node.

                                  `ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                                  to endpoints.

                                  `NodePort` exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort).
                                  To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address,
                                  the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.

                                  `LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                  (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                  as the clusterIP.

                                  UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy pods
                                  should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods,
                                  as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".

                                  Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow.
                                  If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used,
                                  which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.

                                  IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                                  but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not
                                  disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy).
                                  Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                                  AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                                  but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless
                                  of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running
                                  pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy.
                                  Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                                  Additional policies may be added in the future.
                                  Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods
                                  if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.

                        specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the
                        operation will fail. If not specified, a port will be allocated if this

                                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                        completed.

                                              RecursiveReadOnly specifies whether read-only mounts should be handled
                                              recursively.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                              recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made
                                              recursively read-only, if it is supported by the container runtime.  If this
                                              field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                              supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                              an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                              If this field is set to IfPossible or Enabled, MountPropagation must be set to
                                              None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                              If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                              using the previously defined environment variables in the container and
                                              any service environment variables. If a variable cannot be resolved,
                                              the reference in the input string will be unchanged. Double $$ are reduced
                                              to a single $, which allows for escaping the $(VAR_NAME) syntax: i.e.
                                              "$$(VAR_NAME)" will produce the string literal "$(VAR_NAME)".
                                              Escaped references will never be expanded, regardless of whether the variable
                                              exists or not.

                                              If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                              If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made

                                  by finding the highest request/limit for each resource type, and then using the max of
                                  that value or the sum of the normal containers. Limits are applied to init containers
                                  in a similar fashion.
                                  Init containers cannot currently be added or removed.
                                  Cannot be updated.

                                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                        completed.

                                            The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                                            a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.

                                            If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this

                                      seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                                      It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                                      Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                                      "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                                      This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                                      "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                                      This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                                      It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                                      Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                                      whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                                      CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                                      "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                                      If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                                      and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                                      This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                                      All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:

                                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)

                                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                                        TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key
                                        and identical values are considered to be in the same topology.
                                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                                        of pods into each bucket.
                                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                                        Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                                        nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                                        e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                                        And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                                        WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy
                                        the spread constraint.
                                        - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it.
                                        - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to schedule the pod in any location,
                                          but giving higher precedence to topologies that would help reduce the
                                          skew.
                                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                                        "MaxSkew" on some topology.
                                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                        labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                        | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                                        If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                                        to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                                        MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                                        won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                                        ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                        The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                        and deleted when the pod is removed.

                                        Use this if:
                                        a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                        b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                           tracking are needed,
                                        c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                        d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                           a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                           information on the connection between this volume type
                                           and PersistentVolumeClaim).

                                        Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                        APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                        of an individual pod.

                                        Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                        be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                        more information.

                                        A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                        persistent volumes at the same time.

                                            Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                            The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                            owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                            pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                            `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                            entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                            is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).

                                            An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                            will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                            volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                            the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                            meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                            owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                            this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                            manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                    There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                    * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                    * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                      preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                      specified.
                                                    * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                      in any namespaces.

                                        EmptyDir into an InitContainer that clones the repo using git, then mount the EmptyDir
                                        into the Pod's container.

                                        image represents an OCI object (a container image or artifact) pulled and mounted on the kubelet's host machine.
                                        The volume is resolved at pod startup depending on which PullPolicy value is provided:

                                        - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull the reference. Container creation will fail If the pull fails.
                                        - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                        - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.

                                        The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted and recreated, which means that new remote content will become available on pod recreation.
                                        A failure to resolve or pull the image during pod startup will block containers from starting and may add significant latency. Failures will be retried using normal volume backoff and will be reported on the pod reason and message.
                                        The types of objects that may be mounted by this volume are defined by the container runtime implementation on a host machine and at minimum must include all valid types supported by the container image field.
                                        The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by merging the manifest layers in the same way as for container images.
                                        The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and non-executable files (noexec).
                                        Sub path mounts for containers are not supported (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.subpath) before 1.33.
                                        The field spec.securityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy has no effect on this volume type.

                                            Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference and only uses a local image or artifact. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present.
                                            IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference isn't already present on disk. Container creation will fail if the reference isn't present and the pull fails.
                                            Defaults to Always if :latest tag is specified, or IfNotPresent otherwise.

                                          For example, if autoscaling is configured with a memory consumption target of 100Mi,
                                          and scale-down and scale-up tolerances of 5% and 1% respectively, scaling will be

                                  ExternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they
                                  receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts,
                                  ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure
                                  the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care
                                  of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                                  traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                                  the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                                  be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                                  routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                                  features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                                  within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                                  a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                                  when picking a node.

                                  `ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing

                                  `NodePort` exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort).
                                  To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address,
                                  the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.

                                  `LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                                  (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                                  as the clusterIP.

                                  UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy pods
                                  should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods,
                                  as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".

                                  Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow.
                                  If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used,
                                  which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.

                                  IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                                  but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not
                                  disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy).
                                  Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                                  AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"),
                                  but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless
                                  of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running
                                  pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy.
                                  Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.

                                  Additional policies may be added in the future.
                                  Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods
                                  if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.

                                  This field is beta-level. The eviction API uses this field when
                                  the feature gate PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy is enabled (enabled by default).

              `<plugin>` is the name of the plugin that will run before or after the KongPlugin.
              For example, a KongPlugin with `plugin: rate-limiting` and `before.access: ["key-auth"]`
              will create a rate limiting plugin that limits requests _before_ they are authenticated.

          KongUpstreamPolicy allows configuring algorithm that should be used for load balancing traffic between Kong
          Upstream's Targets. It also allows configuring health checks for Kong Upstream's Targets.

          Its configuration is similar to Kong Upstream object (https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/admin-api/#upstream-object),
          and it is applied to Kong Upstream objects created by the controller.

          It can be attached to Services. To attach it to a Service, it has to be annotated with
          `konghq.com/upstream-policy: <name>`, where `<name>` is the name of the KongUpstreamPolicy
          object in the same namespace as the Service.

          When attached to a Service, it will affect all Kong Upstreams created for the Service.

          When attached to a Service used in a Gateway API *Route rule with multiple BackendRefs, all of its Services MUST
          be configured with the same KongUpstreamPolicy. Otherwise, the controller will *ignore* the KongUpstreamPolicy.

          Note: KongUpstreamPolicy doesn't implement Gateway API's GEP-713 strictly.
          In particular, it doesn't use the TargetRef for attaching to Services and Gateway API *Routes - annotations are
          used instead. This is to allow reusing the same KongUpstreamPolicy for multiple Services and Gateway API *Routes.

              ancestors:
                description: |-
                  Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                  associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                  each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                  manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                  the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                  appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                  Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                  an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                  which to namespace this status.

                  Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                  the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                  use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                  that they are responsible for.

                  Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                  MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                  and ControllerName fields combined.

                  A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                  means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                  If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                  Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                  on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                  here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                  additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                  the BackendTLSPolicy.
                items:
                  description: |-
                    PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                    associated Ancestor.

                    Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                    in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                    Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                    the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                    useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                    SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                    have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                    In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                    resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                    targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                    Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                    ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                    Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                    implementations.

                    For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                    used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                    In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                    ancestor object referred to in this status.

                    Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                    relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                    This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                    with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                            Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                            boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                            allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                            Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                            generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                            routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                            any namespace to the Service.

                            ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                            "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                            connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                            the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                            ParentRef of the Route.

                            differently based on the type of parent resource.

                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and

                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                            must match both specified values.

                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                            document how/if Port is interpreted.

                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match

                            * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                            both specified values.

                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is

                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,

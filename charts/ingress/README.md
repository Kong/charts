# Migrate to consolidated chart

The 3.x `kong` chart consolidates the functionality provided by the `ingress`

and 2.x `kong` charts into a single chart. `ingress` users should upgrade to
`kong` 3.x following the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/Kong/charts/blob/main/charts/kong/UPGRADE.md#300).
